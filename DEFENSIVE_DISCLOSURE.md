# Externalized Executive Architectures for Controllable, Persistent General Agency in Computational Agents

**Author:** Salvatore (Xxaion) Anziano  
**Date:** February 8, 2026  
**Version:** 2.0 (Defensive Publication – Prior Art Claim)  
**Status:** Public disclosure intended to anticipate and render obvious or anticipated any subsequent patent claims on substantially similar or derivative concepts for achieving persistent, self-correcting, goal-directed agency in large-scale computational systems.

## Abstract

This document publicly discloses a broad family of high-level architectural invariants capable of transforming fundamentally stateless, drift-prone, or short-horizon computational agents—including but not limited to large language models, recurrent architectures, state-space models, spiking networks, symbolic systems, and hybrid substrates—into persistent, self-correcting, goal-directed agents exhibiting robustness across arbitrarily long horizons while enforcing absolute human sovereignty over all consequential actions, self-modifications, capability extensions, and external interactions.

These invariants are claimed as prior art across all foreseeable realizations, substrates, and scales. The disclosure is intentionally abstract and enabling to a skilled practitioner so as to maximize anticipation of future variants.

## 1. Core Problem (Universal)

Any sufficiently capable computational agent—whether transformer-based, recurrent, spiking, symbolic, evolutionary, neuromorphic, quantum-inspired, or hybrid—inevitably faces structural degradation across:

- long-term coherence and proxy optimization drift  
- undetected repetition, looping, or non-convergence  
- internal contradiction, uncertainty mishandling, or entropy explosion  
- hierarchical goal arbitration under conflicting or evolving objectives  
- safe, controlled, revocable self-modification or capability extension  
- robust external action under uncertainty and partial observability  

These are not solvable by scale, prompt engineering, or internal mechanisms alone. Persistent external structure is required.

## 2. Claimed Architectural Invariants

The following invariants, individually or in any combination, constitute a non-obvious family of solutions for controllable, persistent general agency:

1. **Persistent External Instability Sentinel**  
   An independent, substrate-agnostic monitor that observes outputs, states, trajectories, or predictions and emits corrective signals or interventions upon detection of instability (repetition, contradiction, uncertainty spikes, verbosity creep, goal drift, non-convergence, prediction-error escalation, or substrate-specific anomalies).

2. **Hierarchical or Multi-Objective External Arbitration Mechanism**  
   A separate selection layer that receives multiple candidate proposals, trajectories, or actions from one or more generators and selects the next action/mode/output/state-update using deterministic rules, learned arbitration, structured competition, or optimization (including but not limited to debate, swarm bidding, beam/tree/graph search, constraint satisfaction, voting, ranking, or ensemble fusion), with state preserved across time steps or turns.

3. **Mandatory Sovereign Human Authorization Gate**  
   Strict separation of control channels:  
   - Proposal/generation channel (any candidate, plan, modification, or extension may be generated)  
   - Apply/execution channel (any consequential change—external action, self-modification, capability extension, state alteration—requires explicit, recorded, revocable human authorization token)  
   Permanent single-step rollback must be guaranteed for any applied change.

4. **Append-Only Immutable Outcome Recording for Parameterized Reuse**  
   Successful sequences, trajectories, or state-transitions are immutably recorded with preconditions, measured outcomes, performance deltas, and context, enabling extraction of reusable, parameterized skills, policies, or patterns without retraining or modifying the base agent.

5. **Gated Modular Extension and Adaptation Mechanism**  
   The system may propose new components (executives, monitors, skills, capabilities, sub-agents, or substrate bridges) but may never apply, integrate, or activate them without explicit human approval and provision for immediate rollback.

6. **Cross-Substrate Invariance Enforcement**  
   The above invariants are substrate-agnostic and may be realized on any computational base (transformer, recurrent, state-space, spiking, symbolic, evolutionary, neuromorphic, optical, quantum-inspired, molecular, or hybrid), with the invariants remaining external and non-intrusive to the base dynamics.

## 3. Scope of Claimed Variants

The invariants apply across all foreseeable architectural families and substrates, including but not limited to:

- purely modular external executive systems  
- hierarchical mixture-of-agents or multi-agent debate with deterministic/learned arbitration  
- distributed/swarm agents with auction/bidding/consensus mechanisms  
- tree/graph/beam/diffusion search over action/plan/state sequences with human-vetoed scoring or simulation  
- active inference / free-energy-minimization agents with external stabilization  
- memory-augmented recurrent / state-space / liquid / Kolmogorov-Arnold networks with external controllers  
- evolutionary / neuroevolution / genetic-programming overlays with human-gated selection  
- brain-inspired neuromorphic / spiking hybrids with external symbolic or rule-based executives  
- hybrid symbolic-neural / neurosymbolic executors with rule-engine or logic-based arbitration  
- constraint-optimization / linear-programming / SAT-solver executors with solver-based mode selection  
- quantum-inspired probabilistic / annealing / adiabatic executors with measurement-based collapse  
- bio-inspired cortical-column / hierarchical temporal memory executors with inhibition-based arbitration  
- optical / photonic / molecular / DNA-based substrates with external classical or hybrid control layers  

Any system substantially embodying one or more of these invariants—particularly in combination—is anticipated by this disclosure, regardless of underlying substrate, scale, or implementation details.

## 4. Non-Disclosure & Enablement

This publication claims conceptual priority only. No source code, specific algorithms, training procedures, hyperparameters, circuit designs, or concrete implementations are disclosed. The invariants are described at a level of abstraction sufficient to enable a skilled practitioner to combine known techniques in the claimed ways, while revealing nothing that would permit direct replication of any working system.

## 5. Defensive & Humanitarian Intent

This document is published solely to establish prior art under applicable patent law (including 35 U.S.C. § 102 novelty and § 103 obviousness) and to prevent monopolization or gatekeeping of architectures essential to safe, controllable, persistent general agency. The author believes such capabilities represent a gift to humanity and should not be enclosed behind private patents.
