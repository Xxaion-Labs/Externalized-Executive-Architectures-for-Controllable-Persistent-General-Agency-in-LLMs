**Public timestamped prior-art repository**  
**Author:** Salvatore (Xxaion) Anziano  
**Initial commit:** February 8, 2026  
**Latest substantive update:** February 12, 2026  

This repository exists solely as a public, timestamped record for defensive prior-art purposes.

The substantive disclosure is now contained directly in this README.md (and mirrored in `DEFENSIVE_DISCLOSURE.md`) for maximum visibility and auditability. The disclosure covers:

1. The broad family of **externalized executive architectures** for achieving controllable, persistent general agency in LLMs via runtime executive arbitration, self-correction, drift detection, mode selection, and sovereign veto gates.
2. An explicit enumeration of the **seven realistic architectural paths** to AGI that are physically and computationally plausible within the 2026–2046 timeframe.

**No code, no implementations, no training details, no specific mechanisms, no hyperparameters, and no proprietary data are provided or implied.** This is a purely conceptual, high-level disclosure intended to establish prior art and prevent patent monopolization of these ideas.

**Purpose:**  
- Establish a verifiable public timestamp for prior-art claims.  
- Prevent subsequent patent monopolization of the disclosed concepts.  
- Serve as a static, auditable record under applicable patent law.

**Usage note:**  
This repo is not a project, not open-source software, and not a discussion forum. It is a defensive legal artifact. No issues, PRs, forks, or contributions are solicited or accepted.

## Defensive Disclosure: Seven Realistic Paths to AGI (2026–2046)

The following seven high-level architectural paths represent the only non-fantasy, physically/computationally viable routes to true AGI within the next 20 years, based on current momentum, compute trends, and research trajectories.

These paths all share the invariant of **externalized executive control** (separation of proposal generation from arbitration, correction, and commitment) to achieve persistence, controllability, and coherence. This invariant family was originally disclosed in this repository on February 8, 2026. The explicit enumeration of the seven paths is added on February 12, 2026.

1. **External Modular Executive Stack**  
   LLM restricted to proposer role. External deterministic or pluggable modules (sentinel, arbiter, veto gate) handle loop detection, drift correction, mode selection, and sovereign human control.  
   Viability: Highest current momentum. Scales naturally with base model improvements.

2. **Hierarchical Multi-Agent Debate / Swarm Bidding**  
   Multiple LLM instances (or prompted variants) operate in parallel to propose, critique, defend, and bid confidence. An external arbiter (rule-based or learned) selects or fuses outcomes. Persistent memory maintained via external ledger.

3. **Tree/Graph/Beam Search + Simulation over Plan Space**  
   LLM generates candidate plans → external search (MCTS-style or diffusion over sequences) → counterfactual simulation/scoring of outcomes → commitment to highest-scoring path. Sovereign veto on high-risk branches.

4. **Memory-Augmented Recurrent / State-Space Models with External Controller**  
   Long-context recurrent or state-space architectures (e.g., Mamba-class) for persistent memory. External controller layer governs executive decisions, coherence stabilization, and human veto.

5. **Active Inference / Free-Energy Principle Agents with External Stabilization**  
   Agent maintains predictive world model and minimizes surprise via perception-action loops. External sentinel/critic layer enforces long-term coherence and provides sovereign override.

6. **Evolutionary / Neuroevolution Overlay on LLM Proposals**  
   Population-based evolution of prompt variants, controller configurations, or lightweight overlays. Selection pressure applied for coherence, task success, and drift resistance. Sovereign kill-switch on evolution.

7. **Hybrid Symbolic-Neural with Rule-Engine Executor**  
   LLM generates proposals → symbolic rule engine or logic solver performs arbitration and execution. Neurosymbolic bridging layer. Sovereign override via rule injection.

These seven paths are the only architectures with credible physical, computational, and research grounding in the specified timeframe. All other proposed routes are either remixes of these, blocked by hardware constraints, or speculative hype.

**End of defensive disclosure.**
