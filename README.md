# Xxaion-Labs / Externalized-Executive-Architectures-for-Controllable-Persistent-General-Agency-in-LLMs

**Public timestamped prior-art repository**  
**Author:** Salvatore (Xxaion) Anziano  
**Initial commit:** February 8, 2026  

This repository exists solely as a public, timestamped record for defensive prior-art purposes.  

The sole substantive content is contained in the file `DEFENSIVE_DISCLOSURE.md`, which discloses high-level architectural concepts related to runtime executive arbitration and self-correction in autonomous computational agents.

**No code, no implementations, no training details, no specific mechanisms are provided or implied in this repository beyond the disclosure itself.**

**Purpose:**  
- Establish a verifiable public timestamp for prior-art claims.  
- Prevent subsequent patent monopolization of the disclosed concepts.  
- Serve as a static, auditable record under applicable patent law.

**Usage note:**  
This repo is not a project, not open-source software, and not a discussion forum. It is a defensive legal artifact. No issues, PRs, forks, or contributions are solicited or accepted.
