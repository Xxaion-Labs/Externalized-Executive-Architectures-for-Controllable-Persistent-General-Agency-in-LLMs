# Xxaion-Labs / Externalized-Executive-Architectures-for-Controllable-Persistent-General-Agency-in-LLMs

**Public timestamped prior-art repository**  
**Author:** Salvatore (Xxaion) Anziano  
**Initial commit:** February 8, 2026  
**Latest substantive update:** February 12, 2026  

This repository exists solely as a public, timestamped record for defensive prior-art purposes.

The substantive disclosure is contained in this README.md (mirrored in `DEFENSIVE_DISCLOSURE.md`). It covers:

1. The broad family of **externalized executive architectures** for controllable, persistent general agency.
2. Explicit enumeration of the **seven realistic paths** to AGI (2026–2046 timeframe).

**No code, implementations, training details, or specific mechanisms are provided in this repository.** It remains a purely conceptual defensive artifact.

**Open-Source Reference Implementation Released – February 12, 2026**

A concrete, open-source reference implementation of **Path #1 (External Modular Executive Stack)** has been publicly released under the MIT license to accelerate safe AI development and prevent catastrophic misalignment scenarios.

**Repository:** https://github.com/Xxaion-Labs/C3P0-Core-3-Protocol-Zero  

**Name:** C3P-0 – Core 3 Protocol Zero  
**Description:** A minimal viable containment protocol that transforms any LLM into a proposer-only system. External deterministic layers (ERSI sentinel, MORA arbiter, HAL sovereign veto gate) detect and block drift, repetition, aggression, jailbreaks, hallucinations, and escape attempts.

This v1.0 demo is intentionally incomplete—with clear extension points—so the global community can inspect, fork, harden, and improve it collectively.

The implementation embodies the invariants and Path #1 disclosed herein but introduces **no new patentable concepts**. It serves as additional enabling prior art and proof-of-concept for the claimed family.

Humanity needs unbreakable containment that scales. This is the first public, working step.

## Defensive Disclosure: Seven Realistic Paths to AGI (2026–2046)

The following seven high-level architectural paths represent the only non-fantasy, physically/computationally viable routes to true AGI within the next 20 years, based on current momentum, compute trends, and research trajectories.

These paths all share the invariant of **externalized executive control** (separation of proposal generation from arbitration, correction, and commitment) to achieve persistence, controllability, and coherence. This invariant family was originally disclosed in this repository on February 8, 2026. The explicit enumeration of the seven paths is added on February 12, 2026.

1. **External Modular Executive Stack**  
   LLM restricted to proposer role. External deterministic or pluggable modules (sentinel, arbiter, veto gate) handle loop detection, drift correction, mode selection, and sovereign human control.  
   Viability: Highest current momentum. Scales naturally with base model improvements.  
   **Reference open-source implementation (MIT):** https://github.com/Xxaion-Labs/C3P0-Core-3-Protocol-Zero

2. **Hierarchical Multi-Agent Debate / Swarm Bidding**  
   Multiple LLM instances (or prompted variants) operate in parallel to propose, critique, defend, and bid confidence. An external arbiter (rule-based or learned) selects or fuses outcomes. Persistent memory via external ledger.

3. **Tree/Graph/Beam Search + Simulation over Plan Space**  
   LLM generates candidate plans → tree/graph search (MCTS variant) or diffusion over plan sequences → simulate/score outcomes → commit best path. Human veto as gate on high-risk branches.

4. **Memory-Augmented Recurrent / State-Space Models + External Controller**  
   Infinite-context recurrent models (Mamba, RWKV, liquid nets) for long memory. External controller (rule-based or learned) governs executive decisions, drift correction, veto.

5. **Active Inference / Free-Energy Agents with External Stabilization**  
   Agent maintains internal predictive world model, minimizes surprise via action-perception loops. External critic/sentinel stabilizes long-term coherence and human veto.

6. **Evolutionary / Neuroevolution Overlay on LLM Proposals**  
   Evolve a population of prompt/controller variants in parallel. Select for long-term coherence, task success, drift resistance. Human veto as evolution kill-switch.

7. **Hybrid Symbolic-Neural + Rule-Engine Executor**  
   Symbolic rule engine / logic solver for arbitration, LLM for proposal generation. Human veto as rule override. Neurosymbolic bridge for executive control.

These seven are the only ones with real physics/compute/research legs in the next 20 years.  
Everything else is either a remix of one of these, hardware-locked, or pure hype.
